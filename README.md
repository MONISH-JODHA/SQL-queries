# SQL-queries
SQL practice queries that is be valuable as you enhance your skills in querying databases, combining multiple tables, and leveraging various SQL functionalities.
As you sit down to practice your SQL skills, you open up your favorite database management tool and connect to a database. You have a specific scenario in mind that you want to work on: analyzing sales data from an e-commerce website.

You begin by examining the database schema to understand the structure of the tables and the relationships between them. You have tables for customers, orders, products, and order_items. The customers table contains information about the customers, such as their names and contact details. The orders table stores details about each order, including the order ID, customer ID, and order date. The products table holds information about the products available, such as their names and prices. Finally, the order_items table contains the line items for each order, with details like the product ID, quantity, and total price.

To warm up, you decide to start with a simple query. You write a SELECT statement to retrieve all the customers from the customers table. You execute the query and see a list of customer names and contact details displayed in the result set. This confirms that you can successfully fetch data from a table.

Feeling more confident, you move on to a more complex query. You want to find out the total revenue generated by the website in the last month. You construct a query that involves joining the orders and order_items tables, grouping the results by the order date, and calculating the sum of the total prices. After executing the query, you see a single row in the result set, displaying the total revenue for the specified period. This query demonstrates your ability to perform calculations and aggregate data using SQL.

Next, you decide to challenge yourself further by writing a query that involves multiple tables and conditions. You want to retrieve the names of customers who have placed orders for products with a price higher than a certain threshold. You join the customers, orders, and order_items tables, specify the necessary conditions, and execute the query. The result set now shows a list of customer names who meet the criteria you set.

As you progress, you experiment with more complex queries, such as subqueries, sorting and filtering data, and even updating or deleting records. With each query, you gain a deeper understanding of SQL syntax and its powerful capabilities for manipulating and retrieving data.

Overall, your SQL practice session proves to be valuable as you enhance your skills in querying databases, combining multiple tables, and leveraging various SQL functionalities. You feel more confident in your ability to handle real-world scenarios and derive meaningful insights from data using SQL.
